ESBD-BAHO is a Electric Skateboard battery holder mounting design. I have been working on a build for my electric skateboard on and off for a while and the project received a big boost in the right direction when I found the Alien Drive and Alien Power guys - UK based manufacturers, retailers and enthusiasts with bits that would get me to finally finish my build!

Functionality
All parts cut from 3mm sheet stock as this is what I tend to have in stock and it also cuts nicely in the machine I have access to. 

Parts intended to be PVA glued together to make nice strong thick parts. Make sure you clamp or at least put heavy things on the parts you are gluing for optimum strength.
